		In my current job I have undertaken many complex tasks, most notably the creation of FreeGamesForYourWebsite and a Self Serve Ad Server.
		</p>
		<p>
		FreeGamesForYourWebsite is a website for game publishers. Using this website the publisher can add games to their site with one click either by download or embed code. They can also use xml and json feeds to get game information and files for their selected criteria. The site also boasts a list of 1000+ games, which are free to download for publishers.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Ad Server was created so that our Ad Team could focus on getting more clients. With the Ad Server, advertisers can create their campaigns, add new lineitems and create new creatives. The Ad Server system communicates with the Google Double Click For Publishers API. After the creation of a valid campaign with associated creatives, the lineitem is uploaded to DFP. Once the loneitem starts delivering, money is deducted from the users account based on the amount of impressions delivered.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another project was Birth Of Chaos, which was an MMORPG. I joined the project half way through the development, however, the project was discontinued a few months in after it was decided there were more important things to focus on within the company. However, I continue to work on the project in my spare time, building it from the ground up. The project consists of several different algorithms to decide battle outcomes and resource gathering.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am also proficcient in the use of Git. I regulary use it to commit my latest changes to development websites so the team can keep up to date with new developments. This involves the basics like pushing and pulling, to the more complex submodules system and branch orginisation.
