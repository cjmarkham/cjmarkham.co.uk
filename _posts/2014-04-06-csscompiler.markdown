Although there are alot of CSS compilers out there I thought of challenging myself to make my own.

My CSS compiler will not only minify your CSS, it will compile it, making it even smaller in file size with better compression rates than YUI.

It does this by replacing certain unneeded units. It also replaces rgb values with their hex equivelant and then shortens all hex values where possible.
