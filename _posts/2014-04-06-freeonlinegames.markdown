Free Online Games is the flagship project of the company I currently work for. It is a website boasting over 3000 games which are free to play online.

Recently our team of 4 PHP developers decided to rebuild the website from the ground up. This meant building our own MVC framework and a few tools which would help with development.

With over 15 million unique visitors a month, the challenge was not only making a fast website with a plethora of features, but a website which was reliable.
