Canvas Paint was created as an experiment. I was looking into getting into canvas development and this seemed like the ideal project to do so.

I wanted to make this application simple and straight forward. But I also wanted to add some of the features associated with simple OS paint programs like Microsoft Paint.

The application has all the basic tools such as a pencil, line and shape tool. It also has the ability to undo and redo steps of the drawing aswell as a save feature.
