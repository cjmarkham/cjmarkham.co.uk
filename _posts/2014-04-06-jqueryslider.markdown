jQuery Slider was a project born out of boredom. Yes there are loads out there, but this one is mine.

Rather than clicking to the last slide and seeing all slides before it whizz past, this slider takes the slide you want and places it after the slide you are currently on, meaning the target slide is only every one slide away.

This plugin also boasts several features including vertical and horizontal scrolling, pagination, auto scroll and speed settings.
