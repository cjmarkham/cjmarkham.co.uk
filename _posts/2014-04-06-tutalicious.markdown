Tutalicious is a tutorial repository with a broad range of categories.

I first had the idea of a tutorial repository when I was learning Blender 3d and PHP. The idea never took off then but I recently decided to give it another go. Users can submit their own video/text tutorials and be part of the growing catalog.

Although the project is still in it's infancy, I hope to add a broad range of categories and applications to Tutalicious.
