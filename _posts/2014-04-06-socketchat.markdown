Socket Chat was another experiment of mine, this time to get into Node.JS and Socket.IO.

The basis was simple. To create an application that would allow users to chat to each other and choose which room they wanted to chat in.

Building this application really helped me to understand how Node.JS and Socket.IO work in terms of communicating with the server and tracking user sessions.
