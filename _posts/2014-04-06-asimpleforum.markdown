A Simple Forum was the first big project I undertook whilst learning PHP. The aim was simple, to create a forum package anyone could install on their server.

While there are many open source forum packages out there, most of them are a stripped down version of their commercial counter parts. My aim was to offer an aopen source package with all the bells and whistles of a commercial package.
